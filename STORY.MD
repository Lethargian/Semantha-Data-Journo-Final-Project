# Does Oakland’s new 5-year paving plan still fall short?
by Semantha Raquel Norris (5/4/22)

### Story Description:

Oakland, CA has some of the worst streets in the country. In 2019 the city adopted a 3-year paving plan, and in 2022 passed a 5-year paving plan. Although pothole service requests have dropped in the last three years, the city is still playing catch up with a crumbling infrastructure.

Driving in Oakland, California can sometimes feel like a video game, swerving between potholes to avoid a flat tire or damage to the undercarriage of your car. Potholes have become one of the few apolitical issues that everyone besides maybe the tire repair shop can get behind. 

“Potholes are an unnecessary added stress,” says Oakland resident Logan Marshall. He claims some of the potholes are so bad you can instantly pop a tire driving over them. 

According to a 2019 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) [report](https://mtc.ca.gov/sites/default/files/PCI_table_2019_data.pdf), Oakland has a Pavement Conditions Index (PCI) rating of 53 out of 100, placing it as one of the worst in the region and in “at risk standing”. MTC defines at risk as, “Pavements are deteriorated and require immediate attention including rehabilitative work. Ride quality is significantly inferior to better pavement categories.”

Marshall spends hours every day driving through the city doing deliveries. In addition to rising gas prices, the lack of city infrastructure factors into his work expenses. He has spent hundreds of dollars on new tires and maintenance repairs for his vehicle.

“Potholes can cause a $200-$300 expense to replace tires when we don’t have that money available as low wage workers,” says Marshall.

Potholes are a symptom of other underlying issues such as water damage, temperature changes, and general wear and tear.

After a rainstorm water sits stagnant, eroding the asphalt, softening the dirt underneath, and leading to potholes.

In 2019 the amount of pothole service requests peaked with a total of 5,767 requests. This is the same year that the [Pothole Vigilantes](https://www.potholevigilantes.com/) took matters into their own hands. Frustrated with the pace at which the city was repairing streets, the group of unidentified Oakland residents began buying EZ street asphalt and filling potholes in the middle of the night. The tagline of their website reads, “It would be great if the government did its job. Until then, we are here to fix Oakland’s streets.” 

The Vigilantes raised nearly $14,000 in donations which were used to purchase supplies they provided to anyone who wanted to fix problematic potholes in their neighborhood. But when the pandemic hit in 2020, their activity slowed down. Although the Vigilantes made progress, there are limitations to what citizens can do to fix the crumbling infrastructure. If there is a sinkhole or an entire street that needs repaving, these are issues that only larger scale government projects can address.

The Vigilantes gained a lot of attention, and were even addressed by Mayor Libby Schaaf in a 2019 [tweet](https://twitter.com/LibbySchaaf/status/1125916750640439296?s=20&t=UTob-RPbQKojKOGFkSrueA) about the city’s three year [$100 million paving plan](https://www.oaklandca.gov/resources/2019-paving-plan).

Progress has been made since implementing the 2019 Paving Plan. According to a 2021 OakDot [press release](https://www.oaklandca.gov/news/2021/oakdot-reports-improved-street-quality-delivered-with-measure-kk-funding-proposes-more-progress-with-ambitious-new-5-year-paving-plan) 28% of Oakland’s streets are now in good condition, up from just 15% in 2016. Additionally the amount of local streets in poor condition declined for the first time in 10 years. 

In three years the city has almost reached its goal to pave 125 miles according to Jossie Ahrens, a Transportation Planner for the City of Oakland. This is around triple the rate of paving from the prior decade, when the city only repaved about 100 miles in 10 years combined.

For the city to adequately address the infrastructure needs they conduct a survey every two to four years, resulting in the [Pavement Condition Index (PCI)](https://oakgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/5d844eacab5f40598fcd0e45376d785f). They then determine their pavement plan based on factors such as street conditions, traffic, and equity.

According to the PCI a large portion of streets in poor condition are in the flatlands, which are historically underserved compared to their wealthy counterparts in the hills. In addition to being lower income, these are predominantly Black and Brown neighborhoods. 

In the past the city used 311 service requests to determine which areas were prioritized. Council District 4, represented by Councilmember Sheng Thao, has nearly 30% of all open service requests. This district spans the hills as well as the flatlands.

“In our prior methodology for repairing streets the whiter and wealthier neighborhoods got more attention because they were better at getting attention,” said Ahrens.

Wealthy districts have a disproportionate amount of 311 service requests compared to the PCI index, which is indicative of problems with the system. Many people in low income communities may not have the time to submit requests, know how to navigate the system, or have language barriers. The new methodology of the paving plan seeks to eliminate or minimize discretion in the paving process. 

Last December the city adopted a new five year paving plan to tackle another 350 miles of Oakland streets with a budget of $60 million annually. The majority of capital for these paving projects has come from Measure KK, an infrastructure bond approved by Oakland voters in 2016.

The annual total of Oakland’s 2021-22 adopted budget is about [$2 billion](https://stories.opengov.com/oaklandca/published/wzlrgZzwc). The entire Transportation Department receives about 4% of allocated budget funds. In comparison the Oakland Police Department has an annual budget more than triple that of the Transportation Department.

Ahrens estimates it costs about $1 million to pave one mile. Without adequate funding infrastructure will continue to deteriorate. And despite service requests dropping since 2019, they still outpace repairs. 

When potholes aren’t addressed quickly, streets can rapidly degrade. As Mr. Barricade [states](https://www.tiktok.com/@mrbarricade/video/7036933065993702703?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc), when the department of transportation is addressing potholes it is simply repaving rather than tackling the underlying drainage or infrastructure issues. This is a band aid solution that will never truly fix the problem.

There is no denying the paving plans are improving the quality of Oakland’s streets, but without allocating the necessary funds or fixing the underlying issues, the city will continue to play catch up. 

“Our pothole team really is trying to plug a never ending flow of potholes that sort of keep reappearing,” said Ahrens.
