# Does Oakland’s new 5-year paving plan still fall short?
by Semantha Raquel Norris (5/4/22)

### Story Description:

Oakland, CA has some of the worst streets in the country. In 2019 the city adopted a 3-year paving plan, and in 2022 passed a 5-year paving plan. Although pothole service requests have dropped in the last three years, the city is still playing catch up with a crumbling infrastructure.

Driving in Oakland, California can sometimes feel like a video game, swerving between potholes to avoid a flat tire or damage to the undercarriage of your car. Potholes have become one of the few apolitical issues that everyone besides maybe the tire repair shop can get behind. 

“Potholes are an unnecessary added stress,” says Oakland resident Logan Marshall. He claims some of the potholes are so bad you can instantly pop a tire driving over them. 

According to a 2019 Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) [report](https://mtc.ca.gov/sites/default/files/PCI_table_2019_data.pdf) Oakland has a Pavement Conditions Index (PCI) rating of 53 out of 100, placing it as one of the worst in the region and in “at risk standing”. MTC defines at risk as, “Pavements are deteriorated and require immediate attention including rehabilitative work. Ride quality is significantly inferior to better pavement categories.”

Marshall spends hours every day driving through the city doing deliveries. In addition to raising gas prices, the lack of city infrastructure factors into his work expenses. He has spent hundreds of dollars on new tires, and maintenance repairs for his vehicle.

“Potholes are just a specter of like a $200-$300 expense to replace tires when we don’t have that money available as low wage workers,” says Marshall.

In 2019 the amount of pothole service requests peaked with a total of 5,767 requests. This is the same year that the [Pothole Vigilantes](https://www.potholevigilantes.com/) took matters into their own hands. Frustrated with the pace at which the city was repairing streets, the group of unidentified Oakland residents began buying EZ street asphalt and filling potholes in the middle of the night. The tagline of their website reads, “It would be great if the government did its job. Until then, we are here to fix Oakalnd’s streets.” 

The Vigilantes raised nearly $14,000 in donations which were used to purchase supplies they provided to anyone who wanted to fix the problematic potholes in their neighborhood. But when the pandemic hit in 2020, their activity slowed down. Although the Vigilantes made progress, there are limitations to what citizens can do to fix the crumbling infrastructure. If there is a sinkhole or an entire street that needs repaving, these are issues that only larger scale government projects can address.

The Vigilantes gained a lot of attention, and were even addressed by Mayor Libby Schaaf in a 2019 [tweet](https://twitter.com/LibbySchaaf/status/1125916750640439296?s=20&t=UTob-RPbQKojKOGFkSrueA) about the city’s three year [$100 million paving plan](https://www.oaklandca.gov/resources/2019-paving-plan).

Since implementing the 2019 Pavement Plan, some progress has been made. According to a 2021 OakDot press release 28% of Oakland’s streets are now in good condition, up from just 15% in 2016. Additionally the amount of local streets in poor condition declined for the first time in 10 years. 

A large portion of streets in poor conditions are in the flatlands, historically poorer communities than the richer neighborhoods in the hills. In addition to being lower income, these are predominantly Black and Brown neighborhoods. A large concentration of open service requests are east of Lake Merritt in Fruitvale and East Oakland. 

Vignesh Swaminathan is a professional engineer, and the CEO and President of Crossroads Lab, an innovative transportation firm. He is more commonly recognized by his 1.5 million TikTok followers as @mrbarricade. In one video Swaminathan discusses how the lack of drainage infrastructure in a redlined neighborhood in East Oakland has led to crumbling streets. After a rain, water sits under the asphalt, softening the dirt underneath and leading to potholes. 

Council District 4, represented by Councilmember Sheng Thao, has nearly 30% of all open service requests. This district spans the hills as well as the flatlands. Many of the wealthier districts have a high number of service requests, which could be indicative of problems within the system of how requests are submitted. Many people in low income communities may not have the time to submit requests, know how to navigate the system, or have language barriers. For the city to adequately address the infrastructure needs, they likely need to go beyond the data from 311 service requests.

Last November OakDot announced an ambitious five year plan to tackle Oakland’s potholes with a budget of $60 million annually.

They plan to repave regions with a high concentration of service requests, but many will not be addressed until 2025 or later. And without adequate funding these problems with the infrastructure will continue to arise. 

The annual total of Oakland’s 2021-22 adopted budget is about $2 billion. The entire Transportation Department receives about 4% of allocated budget funds. In comparison the Oakland Police Department has an annual budget more than triple that of the Transportation Department.

Despite service requests dropping since 2019, they still outpace repairs. 

“The work is never done fast enough to really fix the problem because so many more [potholes] crop up,” says Marshall. 

When potholes aren’t addressed quickly, streets can rapidly deteriorate. As Mr. Barricade states, when the department of transportation is addressing potholes it is simply repaving rather than tackling the underlying drainage or infrastructure issues. This is a band aid solution that will never truly fix the problem.

There is no denying the paving plans are improving the quality of Oakland’s streets, but without allocating the necessary funds or fixing the underlying issues, the city may continue to be playing catch up with the deteriorating infrastructure.
