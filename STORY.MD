# Does Oaklandâ€™s new 5-year paving plan still fall short?
by Semantha Raquel Norris (5/4/22)

### Story Description:

Oakland, CA has some of the worst streets in the country. In 2019 the city adopted a 3-year paving plan, and in 2022 passed a 5-year paving plan. Although pothole service requests have dropped in the last three years, the city is still playing catch up with a crumbling infrastructure.
