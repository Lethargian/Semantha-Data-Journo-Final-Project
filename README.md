# Does Oaklandâ€™s new 5-year paving plan still fall short?
by Semantha Raquel Norris (5/4/22)

### Story Description:

Oakland, CA has some of the worst streets in the country. In 2019 the city adopted a 3-year paving plan, and in 2022 passed a 5-year paving plan. Although pothole service requests have dropped in the last three years, the city is still playing catch up with a crumbling infrastructure.

## Q1 - What year had the most services requests? Has the number of service requests increased or decreased?

1. split the DATETIMEINT into two separate columns
  * duplicate the column
  * select the duplicated column
  * GO TO: Data > Split text > detect automatically
  * Rename new columns DATE and TIME respectively

2. Repeat step 1 on the new DATE column
   * duplicate the column
   * select the duplicated column
   * GO TO: Data > Split text > custom detector " / "
   * Rename column F "YEAR" and delete colums D&E

3. Create a Pivot table to view by month:
  * ROW = DATE, sort by VALUES Z-A
  * Values = REQUESTID, summurized by COUNTA

!['Q1-img-02', 'Screenshot of pivot table settings for Q1'](/Q1-img-02.jpg)

!['Q1-img-03', 'Screenshot of the sorted pivot table for Q1'](/Q1-img-03.jpg)

4. Create a Pivot table to view by year:
  * ROW = YEAR, sort by VALUES Z-A
  * Values = REQUESTID, summurized by COUNTA

!['Q1-img-05', 'Screenshot of pivot table settings for Q1 by year'](/Q1-img-05.jpg)

!['Q1-img-06', 'Screenshot of the sorted pivot table for Q1 by year'](/Q1-img-06.jpg)

## Q2 - What percentage of service requests have been addressed? What percentage of service requests remain open?

1. Create a Pivot table to view by month:
   * ROWS = STATUS
   * Values = REQUESTID, summurized by COUNTA, shown as "% of grand total"

!['Q2-img-03', 'Screenshot of pivot table for Q2'](/Q2-img-03.jpg)
!['Q2-img-02', 'Screenshot of pivot table settings for Q2'](/Q2-img-02.jpg)

## Q3 - What has the open to closed ratio been over the last 3 years (since the pandemic started)?

1. Duplicate the pivot table from Q2
2. Add a COLUMN = YEAR
3. Change VALUES settings to be "% of column"

!['Q3-img-01', 'Screenshot of pivot table settings for Q3'](/Q3-img-01.jpg)
!['Q3-img-02', 'Screenshot of pivot table Q3'](/Q3-img-02.jpg)


## Q4 - Where are the locations with the most open service requests?

1. Split REQADDRESS into two columns: LATITUDE & LONGITUDE
   * GO TO: Data > Split text > detect automatically
   * Rename new columns LAT & LON

!['Q4-img-01', 'Screenshot of splitting columns'](/Q4-img-01.png)

2. Find & Replace the () with blanks
   * Select the LAT column
   * Go to Edit > "find & replace"
   * Find "(" replace with a "blank"
   * Do the same for LON

!['Q4-img-02', 'Screenshot of find and replace'](/Q4-img-02.png)

3. Copy columns A,C,F,G to a new sheet to condense information.
4. Filter by "STATUS" column to only view "OPEN" requests.

!['Q4-img-03', 'Screenshot of filter to view only OPEN requests'](/Q4-img-03.png)

6. Copy the information into a new sheet. 
7. Download the new sheet at a csv file and upload to geocodio.
8. Upload the geocodio file back into goodle sheets. 

## Q5 - What 2 districts have the most service requests? Which two districts have the most open requests?

1. Create a Pivot table to view requests by Council district:
   * ROWS = COUNCILDISTRICT, sort by COUNTA
   * Values = REQUESTID, summurized by COUNTA
   * COLUMNS = STATUS

!['Q5-img-01', 'Screenshot of pivot table for Q5'](/Q5-img-01.png)
!['Q5-img-02', 'Screenshot of pivot table settings for Q5'](/Q5-img-02.png)

## Q6 - What are the demographics of the areas with the most open service requests?
